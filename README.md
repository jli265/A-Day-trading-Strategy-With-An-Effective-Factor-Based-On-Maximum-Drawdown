# A-Day-trading-Strategy-With-An-Effective-Factor-Based-On-Maximum-Drawdown
## Summary
With data from purchased WIND database, a favorable day trading strategy by constructing an effective factor from real-time maximum drawdown was created and backtested rigorously and carefully. The strategy might be applicable to a large amount of tickers. This project is mainly done in Chinese. If you feel it diffcult to interpret the report and notes in Python code, please use Google translation to help understand it. Feel free to contact me via email. My email is johannes2019@163.com.
